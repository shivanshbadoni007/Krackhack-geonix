# PayStream - Continuous Salary Streaming with Smart Contracts

PayStream is a decentralized platform enabling continuous, on-demand salary streaming between employers and employees. Built with Solidity smart contracts on the **HeLa Blockchain (Testnet)**, an Express.js backend, and a React frontend — employees earn their salary every second, in real time.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivanshbadoni007/krackhack-geonix.git
cd krackhack-geonix
```

---

### 2. Setup & Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

Backend runs on: `http://localhost:4000`

### 3. Setup & Run Frontend
Do this in another terminal
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on: `http://localhost:3000`

## 📌 About the Project

### Problem
Traditional payroll systems make employees wait 30 days to access money they've already earned. This causes financial stress, especially for gig workers and contractors.

### Solution
PayStream streams salary **continuously and in real time** using smart contracts on the HeLa Testnet. Employees can claim their earned salary at any moment — no more waiting for payday.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **HR creates a salary stream** — sets total amount and duration for an employee
2. **Smart contract activates** — salary starts streaming per second immediately
3. **Employee claims anytime** — earned balance is transferred to their wallet instantly
4. **1% tax** is automatically deducted to the tax vault on every withdrawal
5. **HR can pause/resume streams** — total paused duration is tracked accurately on-chain
